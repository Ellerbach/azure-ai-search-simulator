Customer Review: Terrible Experience

I am extremely disappointed with this product. The quality is very poor and it broke after just one week of use. The customer service was awful - I waited on hold for 2 hours and nobody could help me.

The delivery was also problematic. The package arrived damaged and late. I had to file multiple complaints just to get a response.

I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money and look elsewhere. This was the worst purchase I've ever made.

Problems encountered:
- Product broke immediately
- Horrible customer service
- Damaged packaging
- Late delivery
- No refund offered

I am very upset and will never buy from this company again.
