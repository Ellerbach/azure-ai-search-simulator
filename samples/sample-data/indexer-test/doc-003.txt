Indexers in Azure AI Search automate the ingestion of data from external sources into a search index. They crawl data sources, extract content, and populate your index without requiring custom code.

Supported Data Sources:

1. Azure Blob Storage - Index documents stored as blobs (PDF, Office docs, HTML, JSON, CSV, etc.)
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 - Hierarchical namespace for big data analytics
3. Azure SQL Database - Index relational data from SQL tables and views
4. Azure Cosmos DB - Index documents from NoSQL collections
5. Azure Table Storage - Index entities from table storage

Indexer Workflow:

Step 1: Create a Data Source connection that points to your external data
Step 2: Create an Index with the schema matching your documents
Step 3: Create an Indexer that connects the data source to the index
Step 4: Run the indexer manually or on a schedule

Change Detection:

Indexers support incremental indexing through change detection:
- High Water Mark: Uses a timestamp or version field to detect changes
- Soft Delete: Marks deleted documents instead of physically removing them

Skillsets Integration:

Indexers can include skillsets to enrich content during indexing:
- Built-in cognitive skills for OCR, entity recognition, sentiment analysis
- Custom Web API skills for specialized processing
