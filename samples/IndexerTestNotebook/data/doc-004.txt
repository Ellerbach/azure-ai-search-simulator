Azure AI Search supports multiple query syntaxes for different search scenarios.

Simple Query Syntax:

The default syntax supports basic search operations:
- Term search: azure search
- Phrase search: "azure ai search"
- Prefix search: azur*
- Boolean operators: azure AND search, azure OR bing, azure NOT bing
- Grouping: (azure OR aws) AND search

Full Lucene Syntax:

Enable with queryType=full for advanced queries:
- Field-scoped search: title:azure
- Fuzzy search: azrue~1 (matches 'azure' with edit distance 1)
- Proximity search: "azure search"~5 (words within 5 positions)
- Boosting: azure^2 search (boost azure term)
- Regular expressions: /[a-z]+ure/
- Wildcards: az?re, az*

OData Filter Expressions:

Use $filter for structured filtering:
- Comparison: price lt 100, rating ge 4
- Logical operators: price lt 100 and category eq 'Electronics'
- String functions: search.ismatch('azure*', 'title')
- Collection operators: tags/any(t: t eq 'featured')
- Geo-spatial: geo.distance(location, geography'POINT(-122.131577 47.678581)') le 10

Best Practices:

1. Use simple syntax for basic searches, full Lucene for complex needs
2. Combine search with filters for faceted navigation
3. Use $select to limit returned fields and improve performance
4. Enable highlighting to show matching text snippets
