Azure AI Search provides multiple layers of security to protect your search service and data.

Authentication Methods:

1. API Keys
   - Admin keys: Full access to all operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Query keys: Read-only access for search operations
   - Rotate keys regularly for security best practices

2. Azure Active Directory (AAD)
   - Use managed identities for Azure-to-Azure authentication
   - RBAC roles: Search Service Contributor, Search Index Data Contributor, Search Index Data Reader
   - Supports service principals for application authentication

3. Managed Identity
   - System-assigned: Azure manages the identity lifecycle
   - User-assigned: You manage the identity, can be shared across resources
   - Use for connecting to data sources without storing credentials

Network Security:

- Private endpoints: Connect to search service through Azure Private Link
- IP firewall rules: Restrict access to specific IP ranges
- Virtual network integration: Deploy in your VNet for isolation

Data Security:

- Encryption at rest: All data is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys
- Customer-managed keys (CMK): Bring your own encryption keys from Azure Key Vault
- Double encryption: Additional layer of encryption for sensitive data

Document-Level Security:

- Security trimming: Filter search results based on user permissions
- Use security fields to store access control lists (ACLs)
- Apply filters at query time to enforce document-level permissions
