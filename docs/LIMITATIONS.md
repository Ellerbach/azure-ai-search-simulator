- Testing AI-powered features
- Large-scale testing (>100K documents)
- Security testing
- Compliance testing

## Migration to Azure

When moving from the simulator to Azure AI Search:

1. **Index definitions**: Should work with minimal changes
2. **Queries**: Should be fully compatible
3. **Skillsets**: Replace Document Extraction with Azure native skills
4. **Data sources**: Update connection strings to Azure resources
5. **Authentication**: Update to Azure API keys or managed identity
